## We live by chance and one day we all will die

如果偶尔沮丧，可以抬头看看星空 - 我们只是茫茫宇宙中的一颗小星球；可以看看周围，有动物、有植物，花谢花开，我们都是过客。

来自 Brain Pickings 博客里的一页纸书照片。即使只是照片，纸质书的纹理和颜色也让人内心平静。

## React, respond or initiate?

在混乱中找到自己的节奏。

外面的世界不可控，如果被动反应，会失去自我。

主动做一些在自己控制范围内、可以让自己或发挥一点点影响，让生活变得更好的事。散步、亲近自然、好好吃饭，维持一个良好的节奏。

> In normal times, it’s easy to get into a rhythm of simply responding. Someone else setting the agenda.
> When things are uncertain, it’s easy to react.
> But now, right now, is the single best time to initiate. We’re in for a slog, but there will be an end to it.
> Make things better by making better things.

## How to learn

*Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas* (by Seymour Papert) 摘录:  

> In order to learn something, first make sense of it.

> In my view a salient feature of human intelligence is the ability to operate with many ways of knowing, often in parallel, so that something can be understood on many levels. [分层思维]

> A new learning path: A computer-based interative learning environment where the prerequites are built into the system and where learners can become the active, constructing architects of their own learning. 

> A programming language is like a natural, human language in that it favors certain metaphors, images, and ways of thinking.

> For what is important when we give children a theorem to use it not that they should memorize it. What matters most is that by growing up with a few very powerful theorems one comes to appreciate **how certain ideas can be used as tools to think** with over a lifetime. One learns to enjoy and to respect the power of powerful ideas. One learns that the most powerful idea of all is the idea of newerful ideas. 

查理.芒格喜欢把人们的观念和方法比喻为“工具”。“如果有了更好的工具，那还有什么比用它来取代你较为没用的旧工具更好的呢？

> Two important mathetic principles for learning new stuff:
>
> 1. relate what is new and to be learned to something you already know
> 2. take what is new and make it your own: make something new with it, play with it, build with it.

**Bruner's 3 modes of representation**

书中提到的 Bruner 的 3 种表征模式，参阅 [Bruner - Learning Theory in Education | Simply Psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bruner.html) 做了一下了解：

Jerome Bruner's on different modes of thinking (or representation): In his research on the cognitive development of children, he proposed three modes of representation:

- **Enactive** represention (knowledge represented as action): Thinking based on physical actions, e.g., ride a bike. Babies learn by doing.
- **Iconic** represention (knowledge represented as image): Info stored as sensory images (icons). When learning a new subject, it's often helpful to have diagrams or illustrations.
- **Symbolic** represention (knowledge represented as symbols): Info stored in a form of a code or symbol, such as language, mathematical symbols, or others like music. 

Education shall develop symbolic thinking in children. 

It's effective to follow from enactive to iconic to symbolic representation when faced with new material. (学习抽象的知识时尤其可以参考下这个三层模型)



## 团队在高速扩张中的能力构建与质量保证

听了 Thoughtworks 的一个在线分享 - 团队在高速扩张中的能力构建与质量保证。老师分享了一个案例：由于项目需要，研发团队需要在3个内从20人扩张到60多人。如何在短期内让新人成熟，加速交付，案例分享了一个团队快速扩张的实践经验分享。

摘录**新人成长流程**和**人才梯队构建**部分。

>**构建一个有规可循的新人快速成长流程**:

- Craft Skill Map，梳理完整的技术能力图谱，可视化人员需要掌握的能力。

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RachyJ/rachyj.github.io/master/images/Skill-Map.png)

>- 制定Onboarding流程，各个阶段的Homework家庭作业和检查点。
>- 一致期望，新成员状态看板，红黄绿三状态跟踪人员状态，尽早发现风险并采取措。
>- Case by Case 针对性培训，量身定制、认知转变、技能转换。

>**人才梯队构建**：

>- 可视化人才梯队看板。PM/TL、SecondTire、KeyContributor、Others、Risk
>- 每季度基于Facts的Review，进行梯队调整。
>- 梳理人员提升Actions、帮助团队成员提升。

总的来看，一个系统化的人才培养战略，目标导向、可视化、结构化、流程化以及贯穿其中的针对性沟通，看起来对人才培养和团队建设很重要。

## Kubernetes in action

学习了 *Kubernets in Action* 的介绍部分，没有深入。

书里的介绍比较易懂，还配有很多说明图，推荐给需要用Kubernetes 的开发或运维的同学。

> Kubernetes: By abstracting away the actual hardware and exposing it as a single platform for deploying and running apps, it allows developers to configure and deploy their applications without any help from the ssyadmin and allows the sysadmin to focus on keeping the underlying infrastructure up and running, while not having to know anything about the actual applications running on top of it.
